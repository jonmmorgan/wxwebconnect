wxWebConnect is a library that brings web browser functionality to wxWidgets.
It wraps the functionality exposed by the Mozilla.org's xulrunner engine into
a set of user-friendly classes.


Features
------------


    * A thorough treatment of web browser funcionality
    * Custom content type handlers possible
    * Many DOM interfaces are exposed, allowing DOM document writing
    * DOM event handling
    * Direct POST calls possible

Requirements
------------

wxWebConnect uses the open-source XULrunner engine as provided by the Mozilla Foundation.  The XULrunner engine is licensed separately under the MPL/LGPL/GPL and can be found at http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/.

For convenience, an unmodified binary of XULrunner version 9.0.1 is included with these files; it is also available at http://www.mozilla.org.

This system is a private branch of wxWebConnect 1.2 for ease of adding
features needed by BPBible.  Changes may be pushed back to wxWebConnect in
the future.
As with the original wxWebConnect code, this code is licensed under the terms
of the wxWindows license.
