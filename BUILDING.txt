To build with Visual Studion 2010:
=================================

Prerequisites:
* wxWidgets with the static libs compiled for Visual Studio 2010. Use of a recent wxPack is recommended.
* XULRunner SDK.

Setup:
* Set the WXWIN environment variable to point to your wxWidgets source directory. If you used wxPack this should
have been done automatically for you.
* Set the environment variable XUL_SDK_DIR to the path where you have a version of the XulRunner SDK that you
intend to build against.
* Set the preprocessor directive that controls which XulRunner version will be used to one of the supported
values, currently - XULRUNNER_20 corresponding to XulRunner 2.0 (default) or XULRUNNER_192 corresponding to XulRunner 1.9.2.

Enjoy!
